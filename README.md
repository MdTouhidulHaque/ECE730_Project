# ECE 730 Course Project

## Project Title
**Evaluation of Distributed Solar PV and EV Hosting Capacity of Distribution Networks for Off-Grid Remote Communities in Canada**

---

## Introduction
This course project implements **stochastic** and **quasi-static time-series power flow methods** to jointly estimate the **PV** and **EV hosting capacities** of off-grid distribution networks in remote Canadian communities. As a case study, we focus on the **Fort Chipewyan network** in northern Alberta. 

---

## Objectives
1. Develop a **joint PV and EV hosting capacity estimation framework** for distribution networks, integrating both stochastic and quasi-static time-series power flow techniques.
2. Introduce a **systematic approach** to examine how PV penetration affects EV hosting capacity and, conversely, how EV integration influences PV hosting capacity.
3. Apply the proposed method to the **Fort Chipewyan distribution network**, demonstrating its applicability in a remote, off-grid Canadian community.

---

## Experiments
The experiments are conducted using Monte Carlo simulations and Quasi-static time-series power flow analyses.

### Source Code
To run the simulations:
- Execute **`main_MC_simulation_EV_fixed.py`** for EV hosting capacity estimation.
- Execute **`main_MC_simulation_PV_fixed.py`** for PV hosting capacity estimation.

### Results
- Simulation results are stored in the **`results`** folder.
- **Note**: To run the code properly, all directories mentioned in the code should be updated according to the current file structure.

## Documents
The project report is available in the **`document`** folder for detailed explanations and findings.
